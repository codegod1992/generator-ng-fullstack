Generator ng-Fullstack is a project to allow you to rapidly get started with prototyping full-stack web applications, with the newest technologies available. Based of [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), this is the next generation of full-stack generators. We support the following technology options to allow you to customise your stack (Pick one from each column!).

| Client        | Server        | Node (Compiler) |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :---------------:|
| Angular 1.x for client (JS)      | node + express + mongoose + mongodb | No transpiler (pure nodejs, latest versions)  |
| Angular 2.x for client (TS)      | go + httprouter + mgo + mongodb;      |   Babel          |
|  |      |    Typescript          |

There are many other generators out there, but they are often out of date and don't reflect the newest technologies. We plan to keep this going strong and updated!

You'll be working with the latest versions of:

+ [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) - A sleek, intuitive, and powerful mobile-first front-end framework for faster and easier web development. 
+ [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp)- A streaming build system, by using node's streams file manipulation is all done in memory, and a file isn't written until you tell it to do so.
+ [Bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) - Bluebird is a fully featured promise library with focus on innovative features and performance.
+ [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) - A modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance, & extras.

and integrate with:

+ [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build and run applications entirely in the cloud, powered by SalesForce.
+ [New Relic](http://newrelic.com/) - A popular and powerful web app analytics platform, providing everything you need to ship better software.
+ [MongoHQ](https://www.compose.io/) - Production grade managed MongoDB instances to help you focus on the parts of your app that matter.
+ [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) - Detailed website analytics, understand traffic, sources, cohort analysis, geographic and technological profiles of users and much, much more - all for free! (Pro analytics also available)
+ and Loads more!

# Getting Started

If you already have Node/Go setup, all you have to do is run:

    $ npm install -g generator-ng-fullstack

then to create a new app:

    $ yo ng-fullstack

and answer the on-screen questions. When it's done, you should have [[this | Getting-Started#result]] structure. The default starter project is our [[Todo app | Todo-walkthrough]].

For full guidance on setting up the dependencies and generating your first app, see [[Getting Started | getting-started]]
