# install

```

$ npm install -g generator-ng-fullstack

```


# disclaimer

Work in progress.


# what is this?

This is the generator of the next generation fullstack applications.

Forget about initial setup, ```yo ng-fullstack``` and be happy!


# what am I going to be using?

You'll be using the **latest** versions of:

- io.js;
- AngularJS;
- ES6 (Babel);
- Bootstrap;
- Gulp;
- Express / Koa;
- MongoDB + Mongoose;
- Bluebird;
- Lodash;
- And a bunch of great other modules out there!


Do you want integration with New Relic? You got it!

Do you want integration with MongoHQ? You got it!


# how do I run this?

After installing it, just run:

```

yo ng-fullstack

```

Answer a couple questions, and you're good to go!


# do I need anything?


Yes. You'll need [io.js](https://github.com/iojs/io.js) installed. So, [please do it](https://iojs.org/en/index.html).


# anything else?

In fact, yes.

You'll need to install globally the following modules:

- istanbul;
- mocha;
- babel;
- karma-cli;
- gulp-cli.

 
```

npm i -g istanbul mocha babel karma-cli gulp-cli

```

# um.. anything else?


Nope. But it'd be good if you had accounts on both [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/) - so the badges of build and coveralls show up in your README (don't forget to sync your github repo).


# why did you create this?

Most solutions out there are either outdated or not as complete.
The idea is to keep this one going strong and updated.

Not to mention we've got a bunch of good stuff coming, like Angular2.0. 
We're better be prepared and ready to code.
